/*
Write a code that takes two numbers, the first and last numbers of a series, as input from the user. The program should then calculate and display the sum of all the numbers in that series. For example:

If the user inputs 3 and 8, the program should calculate and print the sum: 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8.

If the user inputs 1 and 10, the program should calculate and print the sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10.
