# Basic-JavaScript
Hello! Welcome to my first repository on GitHub.
I have been learning basic JavaScript from Geocoder.

In the [first session](https://github.com/Israt-Jahan-Shonom/Basic-JavaScript/blob/main/Session-1%3A%20Variable%2C%20Data%20type%2C%20Comparison%20operators), I have learned about variable,data type, and comparison operator.
