# Basic-JavaScript
Hello! Welcome to my first repository on GitHub.
This repository contains some problem solving examples of basic JavaScript from [Geospatial Programming Course](https://ramiz-moktader.github.io/geospatial-programming-course/) that covers fundamental concepts in programming using JavaScript.

## Sessions
### Session 1: Variable, Data Type, Comparison Operator
In this session, we explore the basics of JavaScript, covering the declaration of variables, different data types, and the usage of comparison operators for making logical decisions.
